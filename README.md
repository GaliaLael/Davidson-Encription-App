The app is developed as a tool to teach children about encription.  
It allows them to encript messages using [Substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher) and [Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) ciphers,  
send them to each other and decipher them using letter frequency analysis: compare the message to the known letter frequency in the alphabet and substitute back using the same encription tools (this time, choosing which letter to replace with witch).  

The app works in Hebrew and English.
